# Cosmology-Galaxy_Clusters
A repository of some of the Python codes I've had to write for research purposes. Most of these were fairly trivial to implement, and I haven't really optimized any of the codes. They might be of assistance to anyone wishing to work with Galaxy Clusters, more specifically Cluster catalogs, and needing a quick solution to problems similar to those I have encountered. 

1. Cluster_Naming.ipynb -- Converting a cluster's RA and Dec in decimal to sexagesimal, and naming the cluster according to IAU conventions.

2. Catalog_Matching.ipynb -- A basic 2D cluster matching algorithm between different catalogs of galaxy clusters.
