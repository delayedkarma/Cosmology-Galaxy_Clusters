# Cosmology-Galaxy_Clusters
A repository of some of the codes I've had to write for research purposes. Most of these were fairly trivial to implement, and I haven't really optimized any of the codes. They might be of assistance to anyone wishing to work with Galaxy Clusters, more specifically Cluster catalogs, and needing a quick solution to problems similar to those I have encountered.
